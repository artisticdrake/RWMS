# üåßÔ∏è Rainwater Management System using Raspberry Pi & OCR-Based Water Level Detection

This project presents an **automated rainwater monitoring and alert system** built on a **Raspberry Pi**, leveraging **computer vision** and **optical character recognition (OCR)** to measure water levels in real time.  
It captures a live RTSP feed from a CCTV camera, processes each frame to detect the water level on a physical scale inside a sealed chamber, and sends **email alerts** when thresholds are exceeded.

**Impact:** Deployed across campus, this system improved flood response time by nearly **30%** through autonomous monitoring.

# Workflow Summary

1. **Live Feed Input**
   - Receives RTSP input from a CCTV camera.
   - Pi auto-launches the script at OS boot.

2. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Converts frames to grayscale.
   - Detects edges via Canny and line detection.
   - Applies **Hough Transform** for line detection.

3. **Measurement Box**
   - Metal box contains water and a measurement scale.
   - Defines region of interest for analysis.

4. **OCR Level Detection**
   - Performs **Tesseract OCR** on detected region.
   - Dynamically adjusts the OCR window based on edge position.

5. **Threshold Alert**
   - If detected level ‚â• threshold ‚Üí sends SMTP email alert.
   - Logs value and prints alert on console.

6. **Autonomous Operation**
   - Script runs at system startup using `bootsh` script.
   - Pi powers off and restarts periodically to log water levels.
